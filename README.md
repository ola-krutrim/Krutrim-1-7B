# Krutrim-1

## Model Overview
Krutrim Large Language Model (LLM) is a 2 trillion token multilingual foundation model designed to serve Indian demographic needs through equitable representation of the country's array of native tongues. Training data incorporates the largest known Indic language dataset, mitigating associated data scarcity obstacles that encumber model parity across dialects. Evaluations demonstrate Krutrimâ€™s strong performance on Indic language benchmarks, surpassing or at par with state-of-the-art models despite being significantly smaller in training flops. Krutrim LLM also matches or exceeds standards set on English benchmarks by models trained on comparable flops (e.g. vs LLAMA-2 on 10 out of 16 tasks with average score of 0.57 vs 0.55 of LLAMA-2), evidencing flexible multilingual fluency. Through intentional design choices that redress endemic data imbalances, Krutrim LLM signifies meaningful progress in the pursuit of ethical, globally representative AI foundation models.

## Key Features
- 7B parameter dense transformer model comparable similarly sized LLama-2 model;
- Natively multilingual delivering best-in-class performance for a 7B mdoel on Indic benchmarks;

## Usage

To run this model, do this:
```
git clone github.com/ola-krutrim/Krutrim-1-7B.git
cd Krutrim-1-7B
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To test the base model, you can run
```
python inference/inference.py
```

To test batch inference of instruct model, you can run
```
python inference/batch_inference.py
```

To use the instruct model, you can load it with `AutoModelForCausalLM` as follows:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

model_id = "krutrim-ai-labs/Krutrim-2-instruct"

# Load model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
```

To generate, first format the prompt in OpenAI Chat Message Format and apply chat template. 
```python

prompt_dict = [
    {"role":'system','content':"You are an AI assistant."},
    {"role":'user','content':"Who are you?"}
]
prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(prompt_dict, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False)
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='pt')
inputs.pop("token_type_ids", None)

# Generate response
# Generate response
outputs = model.generate(
    **inputs,
    max_length=100
)

response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
```

## Limitations
The model was trained on a dataset that includes content from the internet, which may contain toxic language, biases, and unsafe content. As a result, the model may:
- Amplify biases present in the training data
- Generate toxic responses, especially when prompted with toxic inputs
- Provide inaccurate, incomplete, or redundant answers
- Generate responses in languages inconsistent with the prompt

## License
TBD

## Ethical Considerations
- The model may produce biased or offensive outputs based on its training data.
- Users should apply human oversight when using the model for decision-making in sensitive areas.
- While safeguards have been implemented, the model may still generate socially undesirable text in certain contexts.
